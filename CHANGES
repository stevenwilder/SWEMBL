06/01/2011
Added ability to read BAM files using the -F flag, dependent on samtools (http://samtools.sf.net)
      being in the system search path. BAM files cannot be gzipped and must be sorted.

3.5
23/09/2009
Added -V option, for peaks to be extended only as far as evidence permits. Fixes issue of peaks 
      being extended beyond chromosome edges. Only has effect if the fragment extension parameter, 
      -f, is set.
Fixed bug which could ignore the final read in a chromosome.
Fragment extension is ignored when using paired reads (-e) option.
Fixed bug in peak ends when using a bed file with different read lengths, the -e paired parameter,
      no fragment extension and the read with the highest(/lowest) start position does not not have 
      the highest end position. 
       

3.4
25/08/2009
Fixed bug which was printing a nonsensical line if no peaks were found.
Fixed typo in help page, -j was mislabelled -k.
Added option -A to append output file(s) instead of overwriting.
Fixed off-by-one error in overlap files. NB: All start and end coordinates are considered as closed
      intervals.
Added bootstrap option -T, which bootstraps reads from sample (-i) and optional reference (input)
      (-r). The approximate number of reads chosen can be specified the -N and -K parameters
      respectively. To bootstrap the input, specify the reference file for both -i and -r, with -N
      representing the number of reads passing quality filtering in the original sample file,
      keeping other parameter settings the same.
Added random seed option -D [int] for seeding random number generator for sampling and bootstrapping.  
Input and reference files can now contain lines in the header beginning with either "#" or "@".

3.3
17/08/2009
SAM format files can now be used using the -S filetype parameter.
New option (-g) added which will calculate overlaps between two files. Files must have chromosome
      in the first field, start position in the second and end position in the third field, and the
      files must be tab-separated and sorted similarly.
Fixed bug in calculating nearest feature for the nearest peak to the (-a) comparison file, under the 
      -O option. Some regions were being skipped.
Fixed segmentation fault bug when using the (-u) subsetting parameter with BED file format.   

3.2
28/05/2009
When using the -R parameter for sample and reference data, the penalty function -x was unaffected
      by the number of reference reads, potentially causing biases for reference data sets of 
      differing sizes. Now, SWEMBL will additional count the number of reference passing the
      quality filter (unless the new reference count parameter -K is specified). The reference 
      penalty specified by -x (by default 1) will then be multiplied by 
	(number of sample reads) / (number of reference reads) , 
      and hence will represent the enrichment required in the the sample over the reference data.
SWEMBL was occassionally suffering a segmentation fault when using a reference (input) sample, the
      relative background parameter -R and a reference penalty (-x) less than one. This was due to
      the fact that the default thresholding for both sample and reference reads starting at any 
      one position (in the genome) was five. This lead in regions of high read coverage, the
      SWEMBL score was increasing, while the summit height was decreasing, causing some peaks to 
      have only negative heights. 
      The default thresholding for reference samples has been changed to the 
        (value of -t) * (value of -x)
      so that in regions of high read coverage, the SWEMBL score will decrease as if no reads were
      observed. A new parameter (-j) has been added for the threshold for reference reads, which
      will override the default behaviour.    
Fixed bug and memory leak in list handling in calculating summits using paired-end data. This was 
      causing some summits to be shifted.
When calculating overlaps, the output is directed into the output (-o) file instead of standard 
      output. Using the -O overlap feature was failing to create files if the output file was 
      specified in a different directory. This has been corrected.
Implemented a "paired" method for countfile format (-C). Using -e will use the start and end
      coordinates, not the start extended by the fragment length (by default first sequence length).
A new option (-y) has been added to run in quiet mode, only printing warnings to the screen.
The installation procedure has been simplified by the inclusion of a makefile. In Unix-like systems
      typing make should compile SWEMBL. Code optimisation has now been enabled by default, 
      resulting in an approximate 25% reduction in run time. If this causes problems, rerun make
      without the -O option.

3.1

Rewriting and simplification of the code for reference (i.e. input) reads. This has removed the
      need for the specification of the maximum number of saved reference chromosomes and hence 
      the previous -k parameter has been withdrawn.
Also, chromosomes for sample and reference files NEED not be in identical order, although not
      following this recommendation will lead to penalties in time and memory. Also, chromosomes
      with a small number of (input) reads should be at the end of the file, as when SWEMBL finds
      different sample and reference chromosomes, it will store all input reads in memory until it
      finds the sample chromosome or reaches the end of the reference file. 
Fixed bug in input read handling - may lead to slightly different results when using input reads.

3.0
06/02/2009
New feature -  the summit of the peak, as defined as the median of all positions in a peak with 
      the maximum coverage depth, is now returned with the maximum coverage depth. Thresholds
      are not considered.
Unified headers for both with and without reference reads (-r).
Added print version option (-v).

2.12
13/01/2009
Converted wiggle track creation from integer to real numbered values, fixed bug in handling
      of negative strand reads in wiggle track and fragment extension. 

2.11
12/01/2009
SWEMBL will count the number of reads in the sample (excluding those filtered out when using
      MAQ and either quality filtering or paired ends [where flag must equal 18 and only 
      positive strand reads kept]), unless the parameter -N is specified with the number of 
      reads.

2.10 
09/01/2009
Added subsampling option -u (0 < u <= 1) for the proportion of lines read randomly.
      Reference penalty is multiplied by u value.
      -N must be supplied.
      If -R is used, parameters are used as if N was multiplied by u.
Reverted to old unthresholded score while using new thesholded score to calculate peaks.
Fixed bug in reference read handling.
Changed -m mininum read count filter from (Number of sample reads - Number of reference
      reads) to (Number of sample reads - Number of reference reads * Reference read penalty)
Changed unique count from union of sample and reference reads to solely sample reads.
Fixed bug in dynamic array handling.
Reverted to outputting counts as integers except if -C (countfile) is used [Change from 2.9].

2.9 
06/01/2009
Changed count file so that double (not just integer) input is accepted.
Counts are now double not integers.
Fixed bug in sorting paired end reads.
